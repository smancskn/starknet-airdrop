# starknet-airdrop

I follow the Information about Starknet Airdrop

First, let's see how many tokens will be distributed and to whom.

Provisioning Committee & 900 million tokens for STRK's Initial Distribution - for StarkNet and StarkEx holders

900 Million tokens for airdrop
900 million units will be used for incentives

 $50 million STRK retroactive for DeFi Protocols in STARK Ecosystem

New discount rates for developers and dapps have not been announced yet but will be announced soon.

I think we will have a lot of competition on June 1, 2022, showing that SS has been acquired and Starknet has become extremely popular in recent months.

Additionally, a portion of 50 million will be distributed to content producers in the near future.

My opinion is that the crew that made the initial transactions and performed the network ceremony is where the Airdrop is stored.


I expect 1500 2000 STRK tokens with a solid wallet.
